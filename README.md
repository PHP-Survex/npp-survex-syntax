# npp-survex-syntax
Highlighting Survex keywords in Notepad ++

Choose from the menu Syntax / Define Your Language ...

SVX will highlight keywords in newly opened / saved files (e.g. * Start).

Seemingly it is a small matter, but it makes work easier (reducing the number of troublesome typos etc.).
Syntax words were prepared by Micha≈Ç Ciszewski.
